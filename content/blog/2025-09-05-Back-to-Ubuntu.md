Hi there,

welcome back to the pursuit of simplicity. It's been a while. Even though I have some drafts in the queue I did not post them because they seem more rant's than anything else.

Anyways let's get to the topic. So I start a new job and settled for the first time working professionally on Windows, which I have never done before. In my first job it was Ubuntu and than a year or so later I always worked on apple machines. So this time an apple wasn't an option anyway and I am fed up with apple for a long time now so I said to my self 'Windows does work well at home while tinkering. So why not professionally'. So I tried and failed immediately. Despite me having admin rights on the machine I could not do the easiest tasks to setup an basic development environment and I know that I have to switch the machine since the on I have right now is not the one which was actually ordered for me.

I was quite hesitant the first two days, but then I gave in and had a closer look again at David Heinemeier Hansson's `omakub`. After browsing around I just prepared a bootable Ubuntu 24.04 LTS usb drive and ran his install script afterwards and it is amazing. I was afraid going back to a proper linux and fiddeling and tinkering left and right to get it where I want it for a start and to do it again. But `omakub` saved the day for me. It contains mainly what I want to use and has easy to pick up configurations. So I don't have to learn everything new and have the benefit of an reproducible installation once my actual machine arrives.

After tinkering with DHH's original `omakub` I could not loose the itch to maybe change one or two things to be even faster setup with the new machine i.e. fully configure our vpn connection and use 1passwords ssh key feature right from the start (which I also just discovered and was blown away about the ease of use, anyways another topic for another article ... maybe). So I did that. Took me a couple of attempts because I did not had a good way to test my changes before, but I also managed to couple together a simple `autoinstall.yaml` to quickly install Ubuntu it-self.

I am glad that I made the jump back to Ubuntu after all these years and `omakub` solved all the issues I had for me.

Thanks for reading and have a great time
Cheers.
